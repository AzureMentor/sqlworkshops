<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/textbubble.png"> <h2>01 - Introduction to Azure SQL</h2>

In this module, you'll start with a brief history of why and how we built Azure SQL, then you’ll then learn about the various deployment options and service tiers, including what to use when. This includes Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. Understanding what Platform as a Service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to the SQL Server “box” will help level-set what you get (and don’t get) when you move to the cloud. We’ll cover deployment, configuration, and other getting started related tasks for Azure SQL (hands-on). 

In each module you'll get more references, which you should follow up on to learn more. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.

Before you learn about Azure SQL and where it's going, let's briefly consider where it started. In 2008, at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft's Chief Software Architect (at the time) [Ray Ozzie announced](https://news.microsoft.com/2008/10/27/microsoft-unveils-windows-azure-at-professional-developers-conference/#IP8XlBTCMpvORgaV.97) the new cloud computing operating system, Windows Azure (or "Project Red Dog"), which was later changed to Microsoft Azure. One of the five key components of the Azure Services Platform launch was "Microsoft SQL Services." From the beginning, SQL has been a big part of Azure. SQL Azure (then renamed to Azure SQL Database and now expanded to Azure SQL) was created to provide a cloud-hosted version of SQL Server.  

[An explanation](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1308.select-an-edition-of-sql-server-for-application-development/revision/7.aspx) of when you would want to use the early Azure SQL Database (2010) is as follows: [Azure SQL Database] is a cloud database offering that Microsoft provides as part of the Azure cloud computing platform. Unlike other editions of SQL Server, you do not need to provision hardware for, install or patch [Azure SQL Database]; Microsoft maintains the platform for you. You also do not need to architect a database installation for scalability, high availability or disaster recovery as these features are provided automatically by the service. Any application that uses [Azure SQL Database] must have Internet access in order to connect to the database.  

This explanation still remains valid today, though the capabilities around security, performance, availability, and scale have been enhanced greatly. There are now multiple deployment options with the flexibility to scale to your needs, and there have been over seven million deployments of some form of Azure SQL.  

Since 2008, SQL Server has changed a lot and Azure SQL has changed a lot. It's no surprise then that the role of the SQL Server professional has also changed a lot. The goal of this course is to help SQL Server professionals translate their existing skills to become not only better SQL Server professionals, but also Azure SQL professionals.
